This project is a lexical analyzer which analyzes valid tokens, following the lexical rules of MIPS64, a reduced instruction set for CPU.

Made by Marjorie Nicole N. Lua 

Section: CMPILER S12

# Requirements
Since this program is created using the java language, it is advisable to run it using a Java IDE, 
preferabbly on IntelliJ IDE, as this is what was used to create the program. 
An updated version of jdk and sdk are also advised since this could cause errors if not compatible with the latest version. 

# Content
The project contains the following:
1. A lexical analyzer located in the LexicalAnalyzer.java file.
2. A class that is responsible for DFA state trasition located in the dfaStates.jave file.
3. An input.txt file with sample input present.
4. An output.txt file with sample output present.
5. A powerpoint presentation which includes a video demo of the program using a sample input as well as a discussion of the implementation of the lexical analyzer.

# How to Run the Program
1. Download or clone the entire complete copy of this repository onto your chosen device.
2. Open the project on any IDE that is supported by the java language. As mentioned, it is recommended to use IntelliJ IDE as this is were it was created. 
3. You can also opt to use your cmd terminal if you wish to do so.
4. Since there is already a sample input file. you could already compile and run the program in your chosen IDE. If you wish to edit the test cases you can do so by opening the input.txt file.
5. After running the program, the results should have successful been generated then showed and printed in the output.txt file.

# Entry Class File
The file where the main function is located can be found in the src folder with the filename LexicalAnalyzer.java. Be sure to check if the input.txt file is placed in the same location as the entry class file.
